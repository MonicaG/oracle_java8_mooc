For lesson3 part3 the requirement was to try parallel and sequential streams with various operations and varying size of input.


The parallel was faster for large sizes of input (i.e. 200,000) for all runs.
Sequential was slightly faster with smaller size of input (i.e. 1000) for all runs.
Distinct didn't seem to have an impact (was I using it right?).  It was the number of input that had the most impact on time,
with parallel being much faster with the larger the input.
